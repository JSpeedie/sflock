# wmcontrib
(soon to be) collection of c programs that I deem required for non-wm X interaction. Meant to be addons to wmutils in a way.

Currently the only program is wtfc. This name will most likely be changed 
(**c**ardinal **w**indow **t**ool, **p**rint **c**ardinal **w**indow. Idk) since
it's probably most useful for just getting the id of a window in a given cardinal
direction and using other programs on that window. For example, swapping 2 windows,
the focused and one in a given cardinal direction. Just an idea. The next program
will most likely just swap the 2 windows. Can probably be done with a ridiculous
combination of wmutils programs but I'd rather just have one simple program instead.
